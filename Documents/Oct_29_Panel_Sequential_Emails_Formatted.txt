OCTOBER 25TH - EMAIL #3: PANEL QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

KEITH TRUE

To: keith@truevetpotential.com
Cc: liyanna.ekwa@gmail.com, reshani.thrivingdentist@gmail.com
Subject: Panel Questions for Your Review

Hi Keith,

I've drafted these sets of questions for you in preparation for the upcoming panel discussion, Veterinary Talent Solutions Panel: The Workforce Crisis - Real Strategies to Recruit, Retain, and Rebuild Veterinary Teams. If you'd like to adjust or suggest additional questions, please feel free to share your thoughts.

If the questions meet your approval, kindly reply to this email confirming the questions. If you'd like to make any changes or refinements, you're welcome to do so.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Please note: 05 questions will be directed to you during the panel. Each panelist will be assigned 05 questions equally, which will be asked during the discussion.

1. How do ownership or partnership models impact long-term retention and job satisfaction in the veterinary field?

2. Many veterinarians feel trapped between career passion and burnout. From your experience, how can clinics design roles or compensation models that promote both financial prosperity and personal fulfillment?

3. When recruiting top talent, how can practice owners communicate growth opportunities—such as ownership tracks or leadership roles—that inspire commitment rather than short-term employment?

4. What are some practical steps veterinary businesses can take to build a sense of purpose and autonomy among their teams, especially when facing staffing shortages or high turnover?

5. As the industry evolves, what's your vision for redefining "career success" in veterinary medicine—beyond traditional employment structures?

Let me know if you need anything else or have questions. I'm here to assist and ensure this is a smooth and successful experience.

1. How do you see culture influencing recruitment success in both new and established veterinary organizations?

2. You've scaled operations across multiple veterinary businesses—what recruitment strategies have consistently attracted high-performing talent across different company stages or regions?

3. Many veterinary leaders struggle to retain top talent after periods of rapid growth. What approaches have you found most effective for building loyalty and long-term engagement beyond financial incentives?

4. In a competitive talent market, how can startup or emerging veterinary organizations position themselves as desirable employers compared to large corporate groups?

5. Looking at the broader workforce crisis, what key shifts do you believe veterinary businesses must make—culturally or operationally—to create sustainable and fulfilling career paths?
