**Hi Kate,**

I‚Äôve drafted these sets of questions for you in preparation for the panel discussion. If you‚Äôd like to adjust or suggest additional questions, please feel free to share your thoughts.

If the questions meet your approval, kindly reply to this email confirming the questions. If you feel any changes are needed, please feel free to amend them as you see fit and kindly share the updated version with us.

Looking forward to your feedback\!

***Please note : These questions will be directed to you during the panel.*** 

1. As someone deeply invested in patient safety and standards, what qualities should practices prioritize when hiring nurses or injectors to ensure both clinical excellence and patient trust from day one? 

2. You‚Äôve advanced safety and best practices in aesthetic nursing. How can leaders create a culture where safety, mentorship, and continuous clinical learning are valued just as highly as productivity? 

3. Retention for clinical staff often comes down to feeling supported in their growth. What role do advanced certifications, training opportunities, and mentorship play in keeping top clinical talent engaged and loyal to a practice? 

4. Clinical staff can face unique challenges, like managing patient expectations or avoiding burnout. What practical steps can practices take to support their nurses and providers so they feel protected and empowered to thrive long term? 

Once you have selected the question (or drafted your own questions) please make sure that those questions are sent to me on or before the 29th of May as we need to confirm our agenda for the event.
