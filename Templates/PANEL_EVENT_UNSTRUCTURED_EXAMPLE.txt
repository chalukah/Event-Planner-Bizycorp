Hey team,

I'm planning our next panel event for the Veterinary Business Institute. Here are the details:

**Topic:** Financial Management for Veterinary Practices: Beyond the Bottom Line

We're calling it "Veterinary Finance Mastery Panel" and the subtitle is "Strategic Financial Planning for Long-Term Practice Success"

**Date:** December 10, 2025 (Tuesday) at 8:00 PM EST

This webinar is designed to help veterinary practice owners and financial managers master strategic financial planning, understand key financial metrics, optimize cash flow, and make data-driven decisions that ensure long-term profitability and sustainable growth.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Understanding key financial metrics every practice owner should track daily
- Cash flow optimization strategies for seasonal fluctuations
- Profitability analysis: identifying high-margin services and reducing waste
- Strategic pricing: how to set fees that reflect value without losing clients
- Financial forecasting and budgeting for expansion and growth

The brief description for social media: "Master the financial strategies that separate thriving veterinary practices from struggling ones, with insights from experienced practice owners and financial experts."
