VET Panel Master Template -------------------------  This directory holds reusable materials for upcoming VET panel events. - Shared Outreach Templates: copy for BDR emails, texting, IM scripts, and research before customizing. - Panel Event Template: duplicate this folder for each new event, then rename "Speaker 1/2" folders to your panelists and update the documents, reports, and graphics with current information.  When preparing a new panel: 1. Duplicate the entire "Panel Event Template" folder and rename it with the event date/name. 2. Rename speaker folders and files to match panelists. 3. Update the workbook, slide deck, and outreach docs with current details. 4. Replace the graphics once new banners are ready.  After filling everything in, upload the completed event folder and shared assets to Google Drive.  Last updated: 2025-10-23 08:45
