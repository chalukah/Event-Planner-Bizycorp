# VBI Panel Email Generator - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Email Templates Fixed
**Location:** `src/data/emailTemplates.ts`

All 16 email templates have been updated to **exactly match** the reference templates in `PANEL EMAIL TEMPLATES` folder:

- ✅ All sender names updated to "Chaluka Harsha, Strategic Events and Partnerships Coordinator"
- ✅ Email content simplified and focused on specific purpose
- ✅ **Structure preserved exactly** as in reference templates
- ✅ Ready to copy-paste into Outlook

**Important:** The template structure is now locked. Any future changes must follow the exact format in the reference templates.

### 2. Link Collection System
**Location:** `src/components/LinkCollectionModal.tsx`

Created a comprehensive link collection system that appears after email generation:

**Features:**
- Collects 4 required links per panelist:
  - Zoom Join Link (Panelist)
  - Registration Tracking Link (Unique per panelist)
  - Promotional Materials Google Doc Link
  - Final Banner Link ("Going Live Tonight" graphic)

- Shows which emails use each link
- Progress indicator (X of X panelists completed)
- Navigate between panelists
- Can skip and complete later
- "Edit Links" button in EmailsList for updating anytime
- Auto-regenerates emails when links are updated

**Workflow:**
1. User generates emails
2. Link collection modal appears automatically
3. User enters links for each panelist
4. Emails are regenerated with correct links
5. User can edit links later via "Edit Links" button

### 3. Panel Assets Auto-Generation System
**Location:** `src/components/PanelAssetsGenerator.tsx`, `src/utils/aiDocumentGenerator.ts`, `src/utils/panelAssetsManager.ts`

Created an AI-powered document generation system that maintains exact template structure while populating with panel-specific content.

**Generated Documents:**

1. **General Promotional Materials** (`General Promotional Materials.html`)
   - Speaker outreach sections for each panelist
   - Zoom join links
   - Registration tracking links
   - Social media posting schedule
   - Email draft schedule

2. **Questions for the Panel** (`Questions for the Panel.html`)
   - Individual question sets for each speaker
   - Panelist cheat sheet with all questions
   - Contact information

3. **Speaker X - Promotional Materials** (one per panelist)
   - 5 promotional post variations
   - 1 email promotion template
   - Key talking points (from discussion points)
   - Registration tracking links
   - CTA buttons

**How It Works:**
1. Click "Generate Panel Assets" button
2. System generates all HTML documents with panel-specific content
3. Shows folder structure to create
4. Download all documents individually or as batch
5. Save to appropriate folders manually

**Folder Structure Created:**
```
C:\Users\Bizycorp_Work\Documents\CLaude Vet\Panel Assets\
└── YYYY-MM-DD - Panel Name\
    ├── General Promotional Materials\
    ├── Panel Date - Slide Deck PowerPoint\
    ├── Partner Details & Zoom Landing Page Details\
    ├── Promo Banners\ (Canva banners added manually)
    ├── Questions for the Panel\
    ├── Speaker 1 - Promotional Materials\
    ├── Speaker 2 - Promotional Materials\
    ├── Speaker X - Promotional Materials\ (for each panelist)
    ├── Zoom Landing Banners\ (Canva banners added manually)
    └── YYYY-MM-DD - Panel Name\ (event-specific folder)
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Maintains exact HTML structure from templates
- ✅ Uses panel event data (title, dates, discussion points)
- ✅ Uses panelist data (names, emails, questions, links)
- ✅ AI-generated promotional content variations
- ✅ Downloadable HTML files
- ✅ Clear instructions for folder structure
- ⚠️ Canva banners must be added manually (not automated yet)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Email Template Structure**: NEVER deviate from the reference templates in `PANEL EMAIL TEMPLATES` folder. Structure must remain exactly the same.

2. **Sender Name**: All emails are now from "Chaluka Harsha, Strategic Events and Partnerships Coordinator, Veterinary Business Institute"

3. **Link Collection**: Links are required for emails to work properly. System will show `[VARIABLE_NOT_YET_AVAILABLE]` for missing links.

4. **Document Downloads**: Web browsers may block multiple simultaneous downloads. Download documents one by one if "Download All" doesn't work.

5. **Folder Creation**: Currently manual. User must create folder structure and save HTML files in correct locations.

6. **Canva Banners**: Not automated. Must be created manually and placed in appropriate folders.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test the complete workflow with a real panel event
2. Verify all links work in generated emails
3. Test document generation and downloads
4. Add Claude API integration for better AI content
5. Implement manual text entry for panel creation
6. Consider Node.js script for automated folder/file creation
