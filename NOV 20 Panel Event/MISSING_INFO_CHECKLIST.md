## Decision Points & Questions

### Immediate Decisions Needed
1. **Number of panelists**: Proceed with 2 or aim for 3?
   - 2 panelists = Dr. Englar + 1 more
   - 3 panelists = Dr. Englar + 2 more
   - Recommendation: At least 2, ideally 3 for diverse perspectives

2. **Recruitment strategy**: How to find additional panelists?
   - Existing network contacts?
   - Cold outreach to wellbeing experts?
   - VBI internal recommendations?

3. **Moderator**: Who will moderate the panel?
   - Chaluka Harsha?
   - Liyanna Faith?
   - Other VBI team member?

4. **Promotional timeline**: When to start public promotion?
   - After all panelists confirmed?
   - After graphics ready?
   - Immediately with Dr. Englar only?

### Timeline Considerations
- **We are already at E-17** (17 days before event)
- Standard E-22 timeline has passed
- Need to condense planning and recruitment phases
- Critical to finalize full panel roster by Nov 6 (E-14)
- Graphics production must start immediately upon receiving headshots

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
❗ **Panelist recruitment deadline** (Nov 6)

- Mitigation: Follow up politely after 2 days; have placeholder graphic ready

❗ **Compressed timeline** (E-17 vs. standard E-22 start)
- Mitigation: Prioritize critical emails; condense some communications

### Medium Risk Items
⚠️ **Zoom setup and testing**
- Mitigation: Schedule early setup; allow time for troubleshooting

⚠️ **Registration tracking accuracy**
- Mitigation: Test thoroughly before sharing links with panelists

### Low Risk Items
✓ **Dr. Englar's commitment** (very enthusiastic and confirmed)
✓ **Event date/time** (confirmed and works for Dr. Englar's schedule)
✓ **Topic relevance** (timely and resonates with Dr. Englar's journey)
