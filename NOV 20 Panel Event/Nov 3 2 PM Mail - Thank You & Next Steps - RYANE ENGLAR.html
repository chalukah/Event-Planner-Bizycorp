            <p>Hi Dr. Englar,</p>
            <p>We are thrilled to have you confirmed for the Veterinary Wellbeing &amp; Resilience Panel. Thank you again for the thoughtful background you shared—your “capacity” framework is exactly the kind of perspective we want to spotlight on November 20.</p>
            <p>Here is how everything will flow from here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The webinar runs as a live, moderated Q&amp;A while our team manages promotion, email campaigns, and tech logistics.</li>
                <li>We will package promo graphics, suggested copy, and your registration link so you can share it with your community if you would like.</li>
                <li>The discussion guide will arrive in advance, and we are happy to fold in any themes or examples you want highlighted.</li>
                <li>Panelists who lean in with the audience are first in line for future panels, Lunch &amp; Learns, and summit invitations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thank you for already sending your headshot, long-form bio, and contact number—they are queued for assets. To finish the toolkit, could you send the following when you have a moment?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Short bio (3-4 sentences) we can drop into graphics and emails</li>
                <li>Social handles you would like us to tag</li>
                <li>Personal website or landing page link</li>
                <li>Any discussion questions or angles you especially want us to prioritize</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let me know if you need anything as we prep. Excited to keep building this with you.</p>
            <div class="signature">
                <p>Warm regards,</p>
