# Vet Panel Guidelines Exception

- Event: **23 Oct 2025 â€“ Veterinary Technology & Innovation Panel**
- Decision: Every registrant is treated as **ICP Confirmed** and marked as **Attended (Yes)**.
- Manager rationale: Current vet panels do not yet have granular ICP rules; leadership requested all registrants be counted as ICP/attendees for this session.
- Implication: Dashboard status set to *Complete* once this override is applied.
- Follow-up: Revisit the vet ICP rubric when official criteria are published to revert to auto-classification.
