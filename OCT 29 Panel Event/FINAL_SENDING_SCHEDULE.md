2. **For Oct 30 morning emails:** Consider using Gmail's "Schedule Send" feature the night before so you don't have to manually send at 4:00 AM and 5:45 AM

3. **Keep all email files open in tabs** during work shift for quick access

4. **Panel day prep:** Have the recording upload ready and thank you email draft ready by afternoon
