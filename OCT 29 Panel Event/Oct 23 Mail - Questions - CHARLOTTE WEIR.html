            <p>Hi Charlotte,</p>
            <p>I've drafted these sets of questions for you in preparation for the upcoming panel discussion, <strong>Veterinary Talent Solutions Panel: The Workforce Crisis - Real Strategies to Recruit, Retain, and Rebuild Veterinary Teams.</strong> If you'd like to adjust or suggest additional questions, please feel free to share your thoughts.</p>
            <p>If the questions meet your approval, kindly reply to this email confirming the questions. If you'd like to make any changes or refinements, you're welcome to do so.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to your feedback!</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Please note:</strong> 05 questions will be directed to you during the panel. Each panelist will be assigned 05 questions equally, which will be asked during the discussion.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Your Questions:</strong></p>
            <div class="question-list">
                <p>1. How do you see culture influencing recruitment success in both new and established veterinary organizations?</p>
                <p>2. You've scaled operations across multiple veterinary businesses—what recruitment strategies have consistently attracted high-performing talent across different company stages or regions?</p>
                <p>3. Many veterinary leaders struggle to retain top talent after periods of rapid growth. What approaches have you found most effective for building loyalty and long-term engagement beyond financial incentives?</p>
                <p>4. In a competitive talent market, how can startup or emerging veterinary organizations position themselves as desirable employers compared to large corporate groups?</p>
                <p>5. Looking at the broader workforce crisis, what key shifts do you believe veterinary businesses must make—culturally or operationally—to create sustainable and fulfilling career paths?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Let me know if you need anything else or have questions. I'm here to assist and ensure this is a smooth and successful experience!</p>
            <p>Best regards,</p>
