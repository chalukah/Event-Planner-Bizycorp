    <p>Looking forward to your feedback!</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> 5 questions will be directed to you during the panel. Each panelist will be assigned 5 questions equally, which will be asked during the discussion.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>How do ownership or partnership models impact long-term retention and job satisfaction in the veterinary field?</li>
      <li>Many veterinarians feel trapped between career passion and burnout. From your experience, how can clinics design roles or compensation models that promote both financial prosperity and personal fulfillment?</li>
      <li>When recruiting top talent, how can practice owners communicate growth opportunities—such as ownership tracks or leadership roles—that inspire commitment rather than short-term employment?</li>
      <li>What are some practical steps veterinary businesses can take to build a sense of purpose and autonomy among their teams, especially when facing staffing shortages or high turnover?</li>
