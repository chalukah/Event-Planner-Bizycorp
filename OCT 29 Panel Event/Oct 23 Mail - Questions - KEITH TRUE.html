            <p>Hi Keith,</p>
            <p>I've drafted these sets of questions for you in preparation for the upcoming panel discussion, <strong>Veterinary Talent Solutions Panel: The Workforce Crisis - Real Strategies to Recruit, Retain, and Rebuild Veterinary Teams.</strong> If you'd like to adjust or suggest additional questions, please feel free to share your thoughts.</p>
            <p>If the questions meet your approval, kindly reply to this email confirming the questions. If you'd like to make any changes or refinements, you're welcome to do so.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to your feedback!</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Please note:</strong> 05 questions will be directed to you during the panel. Each panelist will be assigned 05 questions equally, which will be asked during the discussion.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Your Questions:</strong></p>
            <div class="question-list">
                <p>1. How do ownership or partnership models impact long-term retention and job satisfaction in the veterinary field?</p>
                <p>2. Many veterinarians feel trapped between career passion and burnout. From your experience, how can clinics design roles or compensation models that promote both financial prosperity and personal fulfillment?</p>
                <p>3. When recruiting top talent, how can practice owners communicate growth opportunities—such as ownership tracks or leadership roles—that inspire commitment rather than short-term employment?</p>
                <p>4. What are some practical steps veterinary businesses can take to build a sense of purpose and autonomy among their teams, especially when facing staffing shortages or high turnover?</p>
                <p>5. As the industry evolves, what's your vision for redefining "career success" in veterinary medicine—beyond traditional employment structures?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Let me know if you need anything else or have questions. I'm here to assist and ensure this is a smooth and successful experience!</p>
            <p>Best regards,</p>
