            <p>Hi Charlotte,</p>
            <p>Thank you again for joining the <strong>Veterinary Talent Solutions Panel: The Workforce Crisis - Real Strategies to Recruit, Retain, and Rebuild Veterinary Teams</strong> next Wednesday evening. As we finalize the show flow, I just wanted to double-check that the question set below still matches your expectations.</p>
            <p>If everything looks good, a quick reply confirming is perfect. If you'd like any tweaks or additions, just let me know and I'll update the moderator notes right away.</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Quick timing note:</strong> Each panelist will receive five questions during the live discussion. Please feel free to reorder or refine anything so you are completely comfortable.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Your Questions:</strong></p>
            <div class="question-list">
                <p>1. How do you see culture influencing recruitment success in both new and established veterinary organizations?</p>
                <p>2. You've scaled operations across multiple veterinary businesses-what recruitment strategies have consistently attracted high-performing talent across different company stages or regions?</p>
                <p>3. Many veterinary leaders struggle to retain top talent after periods of rapid growth. What approaches have you found most effective for building loyalty and long-term engagement beyond financial incentives?</p>
                <p>4. In a competitive talent market, how can startup or emerging veterinary organizations position themselves as desirable employers compared to large corporate groups?</p>
                <p>5. Looking at the broader workforce crisis, what key shifts do you believe veterinary businesses must make-culturally or operationally-to create sustainable and fulfilling career paths?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Appreciate you taking a moment to confirm. I'm here for anything else you need as we head into the event.</p>
            <p>Best regards,</p>
